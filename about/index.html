	      <h3>#MarketingFirst</h3>
	      <p>To us, "marketing first" means not having to retool your ecommerce site to add-on features that help you attract and retain customers. Whether it's classic SEO, modern techniques like hashtag tracking, or social sharing on every product, we focus on conversion first.</p>

	    <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
	      <h3>Real-time Reactive</h3>
	      <p>When a shopper sees inventory changing live on a page it can create a powerful incentive to purchase. Or when a store owner can merchandise products to test their popularity, they can immediately know their conversion results. That’s why we're building everything to be real time.</p>
